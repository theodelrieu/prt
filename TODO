Do not embed RangeInfo into HandInfo? (latter never changes)

add a way to reimport ranges

quiz settings :

order of importance

1. only quiz on X Y Z ranges
2. quiz type
3. threshold

move settings from displayer to quizer, restructure QuizSettingsModel, etc

one row per setting group

each setting group has several rows (actual QuizSetting object)

rework incomplete model RangeInfo (weight is error-prone and should not be in the model(?))

add QuizSettingGroup

QuizSettingGroupModel contains a list of QuizSettingGroup, each contains a QuizSettingModel
